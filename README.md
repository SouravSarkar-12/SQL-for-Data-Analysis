# SQL-for-Data-Analysis

Used E-Commerce Data for managing a database using MYSQL. 
I have imported most of the data from the .csv file, but still some of them might miss out due to time taking.


The tasks that I have performed are:
  
  a.Use SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY, GROUP BY
  
  b.Use JOINS (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT)
  
  c.Write subqueries
  
  d.Use aggregate functions (SUM, AVG)
  
  e.Create views for analysis
  
  f.Optimize queries with indexes
